    "Having worked in food distribution for a decade, I probably spend more time than most thinking about the logistics of food. When I eat, it's hard for me *not* to imagine where exactly my food came from and how it reached me. Still, it wasn't until the pandemic, that I'd ever seriously considered the possibilty of not being able to access to fresh food. The combination of fear and abundant freetime are powerful. Long dormant, my interest in gardening reawakened. I found some comfort in the ability to grow a few vegetables at home. It was the existence of urban farming, knowing that food was being grown right here in this crowded city, that gave me real comfort. It also became for me a symbol of hope. Sure the world was a mess, but we might just be able to dig ourselves out of this.\n",

    "As I became more attuned, indoor farms seemed to popping up left and right. It became apparent that the industry was bigger than I'd realized. Looking to understand the landscape better, the question of where these farms were seemed like a good place to start.  "

The Census Bureau seems to have gone to great pains to make it available for public in just a few clicks. The problem is deciphering exactly what it is you've downloaded, so you can be certain you've pulled the right data and can disregard columsn you don't need.\n",

Not suprisingly, the pandemic complicated things and the release of the main census data file, Summary File 1, has been delayed So, I settled for the redistricting file."
