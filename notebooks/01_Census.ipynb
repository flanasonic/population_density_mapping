    "# What's the state of indoor agriculture in the US?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having worked in food distribution for a decade, I probably spend a lot more time thinking about the logistics of food than most people do. When I eat, it's hard for me *not* to imagine where my food came from and how it reached me. Still, it wasn't until the pandemic reached New York City that the thought of losing access to fresh food began to seem like a real possibility. The combination of fear and free time is powerful. Overnight, my long dormant interest in gardening reawakened. The ability to grow a few vegetables at home did provide a bit of comfort. It was really the knowledge, though, that food was being grown on a commercial scale only blocks from my home in this crowded city, that set my mind closer to something like ease. I'd been won over to local, hydroponically grown greens years before based on quality alone and had happily paid a premium. As the pandemic gained momentum and my city locked down, what had once been a source of luxury - indoor farms- became a for me a symbol of hope. Sure the world was a mess, but we might just be able to dig ourselves out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I became attuned, indoor farms seemed to begin cropping up left and right. Apparently, the industry was quite a bit larger than I'd realized. Looking to understand the landscape better, the question of *where* exactly these farms were located seemed like a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Population density and the emergence of indoor farming\n",
    "So, what kinds of places become home to indoor farms? There are a lot of ways to characterize a place, so I decided to narrow my initial scope to population density using data from the most recent US Census, 2020. Given that my own neighborhood can very significantly in the span of a few blocks, I wanted the population data to be pretty granular and opted for the smallest geographic unit for which data was available. While census *blocks* are actually the smallest unit for which census data is gathered, 2020 data at this level was not yet available when I began this project, so I took what I could get - census *tracts*."
